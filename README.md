# Leetcode
this repo shows the routine in leetcode, including code and solution.

## basic info
from 2021/1/31, I finished the routine question using c++ language everyday. I will perserve this until it's not necessary.

## how to read
I create a file folder everyday named after the date I finished the question. there is 3 files under the folder:
1. bin  # the folder to store executable file afetr compling.
2. main.cpp # the code
3. readme.md # a markdown file to record the question and some note.
